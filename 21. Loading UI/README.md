# Loading UI

* This file helps us to **create loading states** that **users see while waiting for content to load** in a specific route segment.

* **Loading states appear instantly when nevigating**, letting users know that the application is responsive and actively loading content.


## How to create:

* creating a special file named **loading.tsx** (or loading.jsx) **inside the relevant folder** in the app directory.


## Benefits of Loading UI:

* It gives users immediate feedback when they navigate somewhere new.
* This makes our app feel snappy and responsive, and users know their click actually did something.

- Next.js keeps shared layout interactive while new content loads.
- Users can still use things like navigation menus or sidebars even if the main content isn't ready yet.

# Handling Global Errors

If an Error boundary can't catch errors in the layout.tsx file from the same segment, what about **errors in the root layout**?

It doesn't have a parent segment - how do we handle those errors?

Next.js provides a special file called `global-error.tsx` that goes in your root app directory.

This is your last line of defence when something goes catastrophically wrong at the highest level of your app:

- works only in production mode
- requires `<html>` and `<body>` tags to be rendered
